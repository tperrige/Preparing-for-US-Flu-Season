# Preparing-for-US-Flu-Season
Analysis of US flu deaths and population data to help determine allocation of additional hospital staff.

In this project, I analyzed data about US flu deaths and population and performed statistical hypothesis testing to help determine the allocation of additional hospital staff. Using Excel, I cleaned, integrated, and transformed the data before conducting a statistical hypothesis test. Then, I created spatial and temporal data visualizations in Tableau. These results were used to build a presentation of my conclusions and recommendations to assist in determining how to allocate additional medical staff.
